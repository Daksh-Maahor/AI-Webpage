                    Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to 
                    the natural intelligence displayed by animals and humans. AI research has been defined 
                    as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives 
                    its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.
                    The term "artificial intelligence" had previously been used to describe machines that 
                    mimic and display "human" cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, 
                    such as "learning" and "problem-solving". This definition has since been rejected by 
                    major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and acting rationally, 
                    which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated.<br><br>

                    AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation 
                    systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri 
                    and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at
                    the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go). As machines become 
                    increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from 
                    the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical 
                    character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having 
                    become a routine technology. <br><br>

                    When someone thinks about Artificial Intelligence, he mostly links it to robots. However, 
                    an AI researcher would define it in this way. Artificial Intelligence can be considered as 
                    a collection of algorithms that has the ability to generate results without us having to 
                    instruct it how to do exactly the same. <br><br>

                    In fact, we can consider both the answers as correct, but in their own ways. Let’s try to 
                    summarize the definition. Artificial Intelligence is:
                    <ul class="dscrp_pg">
                        <li>An intelligent entity created by us (humans).</li>
                        <li>It is capable of performing and carrying out tasks intelligently and we don’t even have to instruct it to do so.</li>
                        <li>It is capable of acting and thinking humanely and rationally.</li>
                        <li>It’s an integral branch of CS/IT that aims to clone human intelligence in robotic machines.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building 
                    methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance 
                    on some set of tasks. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine 
                    learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in 
                    order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
                    Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in 
                    medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult 
                    or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. <br><br>

                    A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which 
                    focuses on making predictions using computers, but not all machine learning is 
                    statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory 
                    and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field 
                    of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. Some 
                    implementations of machine learning use data and neural networks in a way that mimics 
                    the working of a biological brain. In its application across business problems, machine 
                    learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.

                    Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that 
                    humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s 
                    and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete 
                    information, employing concepts from probability and economics. Many of these algorithms 
                    proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced 
                    a "combinatorial explosion": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew 
                    larger. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research 
                    could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. <br><br>

                    Machine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's 
                    inception, is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through 
                    experience. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in a stream of input. Supervised 
                    learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main 
                    varieties: classification and numerical regression. Classification is used to determine 
                    what category something belongs in – the program sees a number of examples of things 
                    from several categories and will learn to classify new inputs. Regression is the 
                    attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and 
                    outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. Both 
                    classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as "function approximators" trying 
                    to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can 
                    be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two 
                    categories, "spam" or "not spam". In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded 
                    for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent classifies its responses to 
                    form a strategy for operating in its problem space. Transfer learning is when the 
                    knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.
